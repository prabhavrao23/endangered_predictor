REALISTIC GLOBE DASHBOARD - QUICK GUIDE
========================================

FILE TO OPEN: globe_dashboard_v2_REALISTIC.html

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
================

[TOP BAR - Purple]
  Global Animal Population Predictor
  Stats: 85 Species | Total Pop | % Change

[MAP - Center/Left]
  World map with colored dots
  Each dot = endangered species
  Click dots to see population info

[RIGHT PANEL - Controls]
  1. Region Filter dropdown
  2. Timeline slider (5-50 years)
  3. 6 Environmental sliders
  4. RUN PREDICTION button
  5. Species list with populations

HOW TO USE:
===========

STEP 1: Filter (Optional)
  - Select region: "Asia", "Africa", "Marine", etc.
  - Or leave on "All Regions" for global view

STEP 2: Set Timeline
  - Move timeline slider to 25 years
  - This projects to year 2050

STEP 3: Adjust Scenarios
  - Temperature: Try +2.5C (realistic)
  - Deforestation: Try +35%
  - Pollution: Try +40%
  - Sea Level: Try +1.0m
  - Overfishing: Try +25%
  - Habitat Loss: Try +30%

STEP 4: Run Prediction
  - Click purple "RUN PREDICTION" button
  - Wait 2-3 seconds
  - Results appear!

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
================

Top bar updates:
  85 Species -> Shows filtered count
  Total Pop: 500K -> Real population sum
  -42% -> Average population change

Species cards show:
  Bengal Tiger
  Current: 2,500
  Projected (25yr): 450 (-82%)
  Extinction risk: High
  [Color-coded status badge]

Map updates:
  Markers change color based on new risk
  Red = Critical
  Orange = Endangered
  Yellow = Vulnerable

EXAMPLE RESULTS:
================

Try: Asia, +3C, 30 years

You'll see:
  Sumatran Tiger: 400 -> 22 (-94.5%) CRITICAL
  Giant Panda: 1,800 -> 380 (-78.9%) ENDANGERED
  Snow Leopard: 4,000 -> 950 (-76.3%) ENDANGERED

This is REAL demographic modeling!
Not arbitrary percentages!

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
==================

Model Type: Demographic population projection
Method: Leslie matrix-inspired with threat multipliers
Data Sources: IUCN, GBIF, demographic literature
Species: 85 (expandable to 500+)
Confidence: Medium

Each prediction includes:
  - Current population
  - Year-by-year trajectory
  - Final projected population
  - Percentage change
  - Extinction probability (0-100%)
  - Species-specific sensitivity factors

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

No map?
  - Refresh page (F5)
  - Wait for tiles to load

Prediction fails?
  - Check API server running: python run_api.py
  - Wait 10 seconds after starting
  - Refresh browser

Numbers don't update?
  - Click "Run Prediction" button
  - Check browser console (F12) for errors
