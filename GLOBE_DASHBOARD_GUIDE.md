## 🧮 What the ML Model Does

### Input: Your Scenario Settings

```javascript
{
  temperature: +2.0°C,
  sea_level: +1.0m,
  deforestation: +30%,
  pollution: +40%,
  fishing: +20%,
  habitat_loss: +35%
}
```

### Processing: ML Prediction Engine

The model:
1. Takes baseline risk for each species (from real IUCN data)
2. Applies species-specific sensitivity weights
3. Calculates impact of each environmental factor
4. Combines effects using weighted formulas
5. Predicts new risk scores

### Output: Global Predictions

```json
{
  "species": [
    {
      "name": "Vaquita",
      "baseline_risk": 95.7,
      "predicted_risk": 100.0,
      "risk_increase": +4.3,
      "status": "Critical"
    },
    ...
  ],
  "global_stats": {
    "avg_risk_increase": +12.5,
    "critical_species": 8,
    "risk_trend": "↑ 12.5%"

## 🧪 Example Scenarios to Try

### Scenario 1: Moderate Climate Change
```
Temperature: +1.5°C
Sea Level: +0.5m
Deforestation: +15%
Pollution: +20%
Fishing: +10%
Habitat Loss: +15%
```
**Result:** Global avg risk increases ~8-10%

### Scenario 2: Severe Climate Crisis
```
Temperature: +3.5°C
Sea Level: +2.0m
Deforestation: +50%
Pollution: +60%

```
**Result:** Global avg risk increases ~25-30%, multiple species hit critical

### Scenario 3: Conservation Success
```
Temperature: +0.5°C  (reduced)
Sea Level: +0.2m  (minimal)
Deforestation: +5%  (controlled)
